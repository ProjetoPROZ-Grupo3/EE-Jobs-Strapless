# EE-Jobs_Strapless
Welcome to the "Bootstrap-less" version of EE-Jobs, one of my own projects made for the ProzTech Front-End bootcamp. The reason that I'm "re-doing" all the work without the Bootstrap is to show myself (and the future recruiters) that I can work without framework components.

## Current State
Currently unfinished, but I'll manage to make it work until July 30th.

## What does we have?
- Some general classes that can be used anywhere;
- A general design (three-banner screen);
