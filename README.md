# EE-Jobs_Strapless
Welcome to the "Bootstrap-less" version of EE-Jobs, one of my own projects made for the ProzTech Front-End bootcamp. The reason that I'm "re-doing" all the work without the Bootstrap is to show myself (and the future recruiters) that I can work without framework components.

## Current State
I'll manage to finish until August 14th.

## What does we have?
- General classes that can be imported and edited with the media-queries;
- A general design, that's used inside every page (three-banner screen);
- Form "validation" on most pages;
- A Google Cloud Platform VM open and running: http://34.95.142.6/
